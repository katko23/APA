### Problem:
You have an array of integers:  
`A = [3, 5, 2, 8, 6, 1, 9, 4, 7]`.

**Condition:** You can only **reverse the order** of any contiguous subarray (a sequence of consecutive elements) within `A`.

**Task:** Determine the **minimum number of subarray reversals** needed to sort `A` in ascending order.  
If it is possible, show the subarrays that you would reverse and the resulting array after each operation. If it is not possible, explain why.

### Example:
For an array `B = [4, 3, 2, 1]`, one optimal solution would be:  
1. Reverse the entire array `[4, 3, 2, 1]` to get `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.  
In this case, only one subarray reversal is needed.

**What is the minimum number of subarray reversals needed for `A`?**oh
